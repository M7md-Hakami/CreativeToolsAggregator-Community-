        <h2>About Creative Tools Aggregator</h2>

        <p>
            We are  <span style="color:#ff5733;">Mohammed Hakami and Ahmed Mahrous</span>, students in CPIS-358:
            Internet Application and Web Programming. This website is our group project
            for Assignment 1, designed to help users discover and compare creative tools
            for design and coding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our goal was to create a simple, informative platform that showcases
            essential tools in a clear and organized way. We focused on usability and
            accessibility, making sure users can easily navigate between pages and
            understand each tools purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
            The site includes structured tables for<span class="highlight"> Design and Coding tools</span>,
            internal links for smooth navigation, and image mapping that connects visuals
            to the About Us page.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the future, we hope to expand this platform with user reviews,
            tool ratings, and search functionality to make it even more useful.
